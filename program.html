                <div>It was created because it's somewhat easier; it's easier to write and easier to read. The use of COBOL has decreased. Despite the reduced usage of COBOL, the Dutch government was still using COBOL as of 2018. 
                In the past, COBOL was also prevalent on many Digital computers like VAX and Alpha. 
                The group that had developed COBOL introduced COBOL-61, the new version, and when COBOL-61 was released, its usage also increased. 
                COBOL-74 is an improved version and has a collaboration with ANSI. 
                COBOL-2002 in this version, it is possible to use a multi-paradigm programming language.</div>
